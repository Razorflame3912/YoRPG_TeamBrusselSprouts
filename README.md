Bryan Chan, David Apterman, Mansour Elsharawy, Period 3

New Features:
- Class VAMPIRE, which upon attacking, gains HP equivalent in amount to the damage dealt, up to a cap.
- Class Hydra,Orc,Merc, and TreeEnt, each randomly generated per encounter 

How to Play:
1. Choose a difficulty (The higher the difficulty, the more monsters you'll encounter).
2. Choose a name.
3. Choose a class!
   - Warrior has relatively well rounded stats.
   - Mages have very low defense but very high attack.
   - Rogues have a bit lower defense but a bit higher attack than Mages.
   - Brutes have very large amounts of HP and defense but very low attack.
   - Vampires are slightly weaker than Warriors, but gain HP per hit.

4. If a monster approaches, you have two options:
   1. Attack with your normal stats.
   2. SPECIALIZE! Which increases your attack but lowers your defense by 25%.
   (Note: Normalizing will revert your stats completely. Specializations stack until you perform a normal attack again.)

5. After 5 battles/abscence of monsters, the game is over.
